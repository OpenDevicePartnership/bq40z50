# BQ40Z50 Rust Device Driver

A `#[no_std]` platform-agnostic driver for the [BQ40Z50](https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/sluua43a/sluua43a.pdf) lithium-ion battery fuel/gas gauge, capable of managing a 1- to 4-cell battery, using the [embedded-hal](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal) traits.

A higher level API will be built on top of the lower level register accessor using the [embedded-batteries](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/embedded-batteries) traits.
